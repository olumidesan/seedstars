### Create a Django application that saves and lists some details (name and email address)

#### Notes 
- The question requested using the Django Python webframework, but I haven't worked with Django before and decided to implement the solution using the web framework I have always used: Flask, with the intent to implement the solution again using Django when I grasp its basics to answer the question, which I have now done. I have also decided to leave the implementation done with Flask

- I used Bulma CSS framework on the frontend for aesthetics
