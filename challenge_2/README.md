### Create a Django application that saves and lists some details (name and email addresses)

#### Notes 
- The question requested using the Django Python webframework, but I haven't worked with Django before and decided to implement the solution using the web framework I have always used: Flask, with the intent to implement the solution again using Django. But I need to answer the question first of all because of time constraints.
- I used Bulma CSS framework on the frontend for aesthetics

#### Requirements
- Simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the application's requirements

#### Usage
To start the application, after installing the requirements, simply run `flask run` on the terminal while in this folder. The application will then be available for access on `127.0.0.1:5000`.
